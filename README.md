## 🎯 Project Overview

**RoGhar** — a simple, friendly platform to help daily-wage workers find safe, affordable housing and let employers or residents list short-term accommodations. Built with empathy, the project focuses on trust, safety, and quick discovery.

---

## ✨ Features (quick)

- 🔍 Search accommodations by city, price, and worker-friendly amenities  
- 📝 Host a listing: add photos, nightly price, rules, and contact info  
- 💬 In-app message or WhatsApp contact links for quick coordination  
- 🛡️ Simple verification badges for trusted listings  
- 📈 Admin dashboard to approve listings & view usage stats
